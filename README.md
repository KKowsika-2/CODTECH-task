A Python-Based Calculator: A Comprehensive Approach

The Python-based calculator program is a versatile tool designed to perform a range of mathematical operations, including basic arithmetic, exponentiation, and root calculations. 
This program offers a user-friendly interface, robust error handling, and a clear structure.

Core Functionalities
  The core functionalities of the calculator include:
    Basic Arithmetic Operations:
                Addition
                Subtraction
                Multiplication
                Division (with error handling for division by zero)
                Exponentiation: Raising a number to a power
                Root Operations:
                Square Root (with error handling for negative input)
                Cube Root
User Interface and Error Handling

The program prioritizes user experience through a clear and intuitive interface. It presents a menu of options, prompts the user for input, and provides informative output messages.
To ensure reliability, the program incorporates robust error handling mechanisms:

    Division by Zero: Detects and handles division by zero errors, preventing program crashes.
    Negative Square Root: Prevents the calculation of the square root of negative numbers, as it is mathematically undefined.

Program Structure and Flow
  The program follows a well-structured approach:
    Initialization:
      Imports necessary modules (math and numpy).
      Defines the Calculator class with methods for each operation.
    Main Loop:
      Displays a menu of options.
      Prompts the user to choose an operation.
      Handles user input and performs the selected operation.
      Catches potential errors and displays appropriate messages.
      Asks the user if they want to continue.
    Termination:
      If the user chooses not to continue, the program terminates gracefully.
Conclusion
    The Python-based calculator program effectively combines mathematical functionality with a user-friendly interface and robust error handling.
    It serves as a valuable tool for various mathematical computations, demonstrating the power and versatility of Python programming.
